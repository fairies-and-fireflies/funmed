FNP-BC, AFMCP</strong></h3><p>Joy started her college career as a collegiate swimmer and chemistry major at Mary Washington University aiming for a career in medicine.  After some research she stumbled onto the option of a nurse practitioner degree.   Nursing would allow her to spend time with patients, focus on wellness and education, and achieve more of a work/life/family balance.  It was the perfect fit!</p><p>After graduating with a BSN from Radford University in 2005, she worked as a community health nurse in a clinic in Costa Rica, and then later as an ER and labor and delivery nurse for Lewis-Gale Hospital.  In 2009 she graduated with a MSN as a family nurse practitioner.  Upon graduation, Joy worked for 15 years in a wonderful, community based, family medicine practice, caring for patients of all ages including prenatal care, pediatric wellness and acute care, and adult care throughout the lifespan, especially of women.  </p><p>After a personal journey of infertility in 2010, Joy became interested in a more integrative approach to wellness, including the impact of food and environment on health.  She began studying nutrition more deeply, and adding evidence based integrative options to her family practice.  </p><p>Another driver for change was the continual frustration in available options for patients with diagnosis such as mood disorders, gut dysbiosis, and hormone imbalances.  In researching healing interventions for these patients, she stumbled onto the field of functional medicine. </p><p class="msg msg--highlight">"It was like discovering the missing piece, in my toolkit!  I suddenly had better testing and treatment options for things that previously had been a group of symptoms I was just supposed to 'manage'.  I began to feel so much more hopeful that healing truly could be more than just labeling disease and managing symptoms.  I knew intuitively that food and environment mattered so much more than traditional medicine was acknowledging." </p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/BadilloFamily-2.png" alt="" width="190" height="338"

practice.  </p><p>In 2022 she decided to pursue certification in functional medicine and was accepted to the IFM certification program, completing AFMCP in early 2023.  With the challenge of applying functional medicine in a conventional setting becoming increasingly complex, Joy resigned her role with Carilion Clinic in 2023, to pursue a functional medicine private practice.  In January of 2025 Renaissance Health was born.  </p><p>In her spare time Joy hybrid homeschools her four children (with her amazing husband Brian), enjoys organic gardening, bee keeping, baking sourdough bread, reading, and all things weight lifting!  </p><hr><h3 id="alyson-flaim"><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"

MS/OT, IFM Health &amp; Wellness Coach</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Alyson – Your Partner in Holistic Health &amp; Wellness</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I’m Alyson! I’m a licensed occupational therapist with over a decade of experience helping individuals stay healthy, independent, active, and empowered in their daily lives. My passion is guiding people to live fully—whether that means improving sleep, mastering health &amp; nutrition, managing stress, or finding more balance and joy in life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My approach is holistic and personalized. I look at the full picture—physical, emotional, social, and even cultural factors—to create wellness plans that truly work for you. Whether you're recovering from illness, navigating lifestyle changes, or simply wanting to feel your best, I’m here to support you every step of the way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to occupational therapy, I’m training to become a Functional Medicine Health &amp; Wellness Coach through the FMCA and NBHWC. I am also earning a certification in Food as Medicine, bringing the power of nutrition and prevention into everything I do. With a strong background in clean beauty, clean eating, and whole-body detoxification, I offer a truly integrative approach to health.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Renaissance Health, I work alongside Joy as a Functional Medicine Health Coach AND Occupational Therapist, helping clients like you implement sustainable, lasting changes. From understanding your health &amp; wellness recommendations to making small, impactful lifestyle shifts, I’ll provide the tools, accountability, and encouragement you need to thrive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I am not working, you’ll likely find me spending time with my three young kids &amp; husband, exercising, or enjoying the outdoors. I believe in the power of a balanced lifestyle and love to practice what I preach!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are ready to take control of your health, uncover the root causes of your challenges, and feel empowered in your wellness journey—I’d be honored to support you. Let’s work together to help you live better, feel stronger, and thrive—mind, body, and spirit!</span></p><hr><h3 id="kathryn-olinger"><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/k-sneak-peeks-6.JPEG" alt="" width="2160" height="3240" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-xs.JPEG 640w, https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-sm.JPEG 768w, https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-md.JPEG 1024w, https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-lg.JPEG 1366w, https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-xl.JPEG 1600w, https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/media/posts/2/responsive/k-sneak-peeks-6-2xl.JPEG 1920w"></figure>Kathryn Olinger, NBC-HWC, IIN, PNL1, NASM CPT</h3><p class="p1">Hi! I’m Kathryn, A National Board-Certified Health &amp; Wellness Coach, Nutritionist, Founder &amp; CEO of Impact Health, and Personal Trainer.</p><p class="p1">Helping people transform their health and reclaim confidence in their bodies is truly the heart behind everything I do.</p><p class="p1">Through a fully client-led and client-centered approach, I support individuals in taking back control of their health. I specialize in working with those who are at high risk of chronic disease, have a history of disordered eating, are needing to improve bloodwork, reduce stress, balance hormones, or optimize macros and nutrition.</p><p class="p1">I offer specialized guidance for clients using GLP-1 medications, helping ensure their nutrition, and lifestyle habits support long-term, sustainable success.</p><p class="p1">I believe there is a major gap in the world of nutrition and wellness. There is no one size fits all approach. Every person’s health story, body, lifestyle, and needs are different. With an approach rooted in personalization, I’ve had the amazing opportunity to support and walk alongside hundreds of clients as we’ve worked together to change their lives from the inside out.</p><p class="p1">As a mom of four, I also understand firsthand that your plan <i>must</i> be realistic in order to work. Long-term change doesn’t happen through perfection—it happens through realistic expectations, sustainable habits, and a plan that genuinely fits your life.</p><p class="p1">With certifications in nutrition, weight loss, hormonal health, integrative and functional wellness, and fitness, I help clients make small, meaningful shifts that build into life-changing transformation over time. Wellness is personal. It’s intentional. And it’s absolutely possible—with the right kind of support.</p><p class="p1">This work is more than my profession—it’s who I am. And I’m grateful for every person I get to walk alongside in their journey!</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://renaissancehealth.practicebetter.io/#/6796d6ca29583da0bc201bfe/bookings?r&#x3D;67af7d5bba3c5cb2dfcc6e0c&amp;step&#x3D;services" class="al" target="_self">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/terms-and-conditions/" class="al" target="_self">Terms and Conditions</a></li><li><a href="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/privacy-policy/" class="al" target="_self">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/website-disclaimer/" class="al" target="_self">Disclaimer</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>100 Ardmore Street, Suite 202<br>Blacksburg, VA 24060</p><p>Fax:  540-888-8745</p><p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%;" src="../media/files/RHG_logo_name.png"></p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://renaissancehealthgroup.org/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
