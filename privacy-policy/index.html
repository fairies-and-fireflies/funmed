Practice takes precautions to protect Personal Information. When customers submit Personal Information via the Website, it is protected both online and offline. Whenever Practice collects sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to Practice in a secure way. Customers can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of their web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p><p class="p7">While Practice uses encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to Personal Information. The computers and servers in which we store Personal Information are kept in a secure environment.</p><p class="p7">However, unfortunately, please note that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered within transit by a third party.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Confidential Information. </strong></p><p class="p2">All Personal Information collected by Practice will be held in confidentiality and will not be disclosed to third parties, except that we may disclose Personal Information: (1) pursuant to the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, (2) if we are required to do so by law, (3) in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law, (4) to comply with legal process served on us, our partners, sponsors, investors, or affiliates, (5) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users and/or (6) to act as immediately necessary in order to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Practice will not sell, distribute or lease your Personal Information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Access by Third Parties.</strong></p><p class="p2">Note that whenever you make your Personal Information available for access or viewing by third parties through our Website, programs, products, or services, and social media, the information you share also can be seen, collected and used by third parties and, therefore, we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information that you voluntarily share online or in any other manner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Practice also is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on the websites outside of our Website.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Use of Cookies.</strong></p><p class="p2">A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive by a web page server to help Practice improve customers’ access to our Website and identify repeat visitors to our Website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.
